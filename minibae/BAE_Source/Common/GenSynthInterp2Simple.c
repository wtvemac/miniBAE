**
** Modification History:
**
**  1/18/96     Spruced up for C++ extra error checking
**              Changed the macro 'THE_CHECK' to accept a type for typecasting the source pointer
**  3/1/96      Removed extra PV_DoCallBack, and PV_GetWavePitch
**  4/25/96     Fixed bug with PV_ServeInterp2PartialBuffer16 that preserved the amp differently 
**              than PV_ServeInterpFulllBuffer16. Caused a click when playing mono with mono output
**  5/2/96      Changed 'int's to INT32 and to BOOL_FLAG
**  7/8/96      Improved enveloping and wave shaping code
**  7/10/96     Fixed stereo filter bug
**  12/30/96    Changed copyright
**  6/4/97      Added USE_SMALL_MEMORY_REVERB tests around code to disable when this
**              flag is used
**  2/3/98      Renamed songBufferLeftMono to songBufferDry
**  2/8/98      Changed BOOL_FLAG to XBOOL
**  2/20/98     now support variable send chorus as well as reverb
**
**  6/5/98      Jim Nitchals RIP    1/15/62 - 6/5/98
**              I'm going to miss your irreverent humor. Your coding style and desire
**              to make things as fast as possible. Your collaboration behind this entire
**              codebase. Your absolute belief in creating the best possible relationships 
**              from honesty and integrity. Your ability to enjoy conversation. Your business 
**              savvy in understanding the big picture. Your gentleness. Your willingness 
**              to understand someone else's way of thinking. Your debates on the latest 
**              political issues. Your generosity. Your great mimicking of cartoon voices. 
**              Your friendship. - Steve Hales
**
**  11/10/98    Removed CLIP macro
**  11/23/98    Added support for Intel Katmai CPU
**  1/4/99      Removed FAR macro. Re ordered Katmai code and duplicated inner loops
**  10/19/99    MSD: switched to REVERB_USED and LOOPS_USED
**  11/10/99    Added WRITE_LOOPS code to write out inner loops into file. Used
**              for debugging
**              Split from GenSynthInterp2.c
**              Removed Katmai code
**              Added some comments
**              Removed stereo support
**  12/11/2000  Removed 8-bit source sample inner loops
